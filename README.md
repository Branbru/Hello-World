# Hello-World my name is Brandon. I'm from Natchez, MS. I'm 39 and I'll be 40 on the 18th this month in the year of 2024. I'm somewhat new to programming but I've always been interested. Life just has it's way of carrying us down it's own path if you know what I mean....None the less; I'm here now with a will to learn.
